What is hashing?
Hashing is a process used in computer science and cryptography to convert data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters, typically for the purpose of ensuring data integrity and security. The output of a hash function, known as a hash value or hash code, is unique to the input data and appears random, making it difficult to reverse-engineer the original input.


What is Bcrypt?
Bcrypt, on the other hand, is a widely-used cryptographic hashing algorithm designed specifically for securely hashing passwords. It's distinguished by its ability to adjust the computational cost, making it slower and more resilient to brute-force attacks as hardware improves over time. Bcrypt is favored for password hashing due to its strong security properties and resistance to various cryptographic attacks.

Why this is importance ?
Understanding hashing and using secure hashing algorithms like Bcrypt is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data, particularly passwords, in software applications. Here's why it's important:

1. Data Security: Hashing protects sensitive information like passwords by converting it into a unique code that's tough to reverse-engineer.
2. Defense Against Attacks: Secure algorithms like Bcrypt make it hard for attackers to guess passwords, slowing down brute-force attacks.
3. Data Integrity: Hashing helps detect any changes to data, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.
4. Compliance: Following secure hashing practices is often a requirement for data protection regulations.
5. User Trust: Implementing strong security measures builds trust with users, showing commitment to their privacy.
6. Long-Term Protection: Bcrypt remains secure even as technology advances, ensuring lasting security.

In short, hashing and Bcrypt are crucial for protecting data, preventing attacks, meeting regulations, building trust, and ensuring long-term security.
